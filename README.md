If programmers were building houses
==================================

The repo contains a bulgarian and an english translations of a humorous story about what the world would be if programmers were building houses. I suppose the original of this gem has Russian origin (based on the holidays celebrated) but havenâ€™t actually seen any other than the bulgarian version. Enjoy!!!
